# Chaos Gear

A Minecraft Forge mod that gives you a **random set of gear and tools every 15 seconds**.

## 🎮 What It Does

- Every 15 seconds:
  - Your armor slots (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots) are **cleared and refilled with random gear**
  - Your first 5 hotbar slots are **cleared and filled with random weapons/tools**
  - You **have no control** over your loadout — just survive the madness!
